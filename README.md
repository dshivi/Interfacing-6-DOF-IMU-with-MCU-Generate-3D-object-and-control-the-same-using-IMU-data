# Interfacing-6-DOF-IMU-with-MCU-Generate-3D-object-and-control-the-same-using-IMU-data
The interfacing of a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), specifically the MPU-6050 sensor, with the ATmega328 microcontroller unit (MCU). The core objective is to process IMU data to generate a real-time 3D computerized object using the Processing environment.
